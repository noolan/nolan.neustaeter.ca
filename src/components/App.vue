          Hello, my name is Nolan and I make things. Mostly I make things for web browsers but I also make:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>overcomplicated woodworking projects</li>
          <li>really cute kids (four so far!)</li>
          <li>a fantastic butternut squash soup</li>
          <li>lame &ldquo;dad&rdquo; jokes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I first started making websites for family and friends 17 years ago. Since then, I've worked with other platforms and languages but I'm always drawn back, eventually.
          <br />
          Some people complain about how fast the industry changes but that's always been one of my favorite aspects of web development. There's always a new or interesting language, library, or platform to learn so boredom is hard to come by.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lately, I've been focussing more on front-end development so I've been able to learn some amazing libraries like React and Vue.js as well as some of the newer tooling projects like Webpack.
        </p>
        <p>
          I currently use a Macbook Pro for development with as many monitors attached as I can manage.<br />
          My primary editor for the last year has been Atom but I keep Sublime Text around for really big files and I use VIM when I'm working in a terminal.<br />
          In Atom I'm using Atom Material for the UI theme, Firewatch for syntax and Fira Code for my font. (LIGATURES!!!).

            In 2015 I rebuilt my companies product listing component using React.

                It features a prominent search bar, optional filters, and automatic pagination when the user scrolls near the bottom of the page.<br />
                The product data is stored locally as an array of JavaScript objects so the searching, sorting, and filtering is nearly instant. The design features a generous amount of whitespace and is fully responsive on smaller devices.

            This last year I have been tasked with building a completely new product for the company which has been awesome.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can't go into much detail since the product hasn't been officially announced but the technology stack I chose was:

                <dt>Hosting</dt>
                <dd>Amazon Web Services EC2 - fast and cost efficient</dd>

                <dt>Web Server</dt>
                <dd>Nginx - fast and very configurable</dd>

                <dt>Backend language</dt>
                <dd>PHP7 - huge speed improvement over PHP5.x and the other devs are already familiar with PHP from our existing products</dd>

                <dt>Backend framework</dt>
                <dd>Laravel 5 - I've been using Laravel since version 2 and I love it's attention to code readabillity and having an easy to use API</dd>

                <dt>Frontend framework</dt>
                <dd>Vue.js - This was a tossup between Vue and React. The main deciding factor was that I would soon be bringing some junior devs on to the project and React has a steep learning curve at the beginning</dd>

            This type of project is something that I have worked on a few times in the past so I already had some ideas that I wanted to try out in regards to how to configure the web server and the data structure.<br>
            It's on the home stretch now so as I'm able, I'll add more details about this new product <strong>here</strong>.
